This week our assignment was to re-create the tours page on the travel-fly prototype, as well as each individual tour package. All of these pages had to be responsive and look exactly like the prototype does. The main focus was to identify what pages were nearly identical, and focus on making one page work exactly how you want it to, to make developing the other pages much easier. The biggest challenge for me would honestly be getting that initial page set up and loaded how I wanted to. After that, it was pretty easy.
